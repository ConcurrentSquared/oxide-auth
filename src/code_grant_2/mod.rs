//! Available backend algorithsm.
//!
//! The backend codifies the requirements from the rfc into types and functions as safely as
//! possible. It is, in contrast to the frontend, not concrete in the required type but rather
//! uses a trait based internal reqpresentation.
//! The result of the backend are abstract results, actions which should be executed or relayed
//! by the frontend using its available types. Abstract in this sense means that the reponses
//! from the backend are not generic on an input type.
//! Another consideration is the possiblilty of reusing some components with other oauth schemes.
//! In this way, the backend is used to group necessary types and as an interface to implementors,
//! to be able to infer the range of applicable end effectors (i.e. authorizers, issuer, registrars).
