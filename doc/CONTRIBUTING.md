Contributing
============

Help in development is always welcome!  Whether you have a bugfix, new features, new ideas or just want to correct a typo in some documentation, the easiest way to track its progress is by opening a tracking issue.

In case you already have working code - even better. Simply link the pull request in the issue. If you have not done so already, you may also add yourself to the [list of constributors][contributors]. If you do not have code ready to be shared, you should be added by whoever resolves your issue.

By contributing code, you agree to make it available under the MIT license and assure that you have the legal rights to do so.

This project generally follows a **full disclosure principle**.  We believe that vulnerabilities are fixed most swiftly when shared openly. As this project is mainly a library and not end-user software, it also enables other developers to react in an informed manner.  Should you nevertheless believe this method to be inappropriate, you may discuss bugs over [encrypted e-mail][pgp-key].
